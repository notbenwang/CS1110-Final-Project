# CS1110-Final-Project

## Motivation
The purpose of this project was to serve as a final project for the Intro CS course (CS 1110), and was completed in partnership with Thomas Nguyen. 
This project was created in Python and uses a Python library developed by Lucas Tychonievich (which you can see as the 'gamebox.py' file).

For more specific deals on the project, check the comments in the game.py file.

## How to Use
If for some reason you would ever want to run the game, you would need the game.py, gamebox.py, the images folder, and any other dependencies needed to get the python files to run in a directory (I believe it should just be pygame), and just need to run the game.py file.

## Review
As one of the first CS projects I've worked on, in a black box, I found the actual project to be rather impressive and genuinely sort of fun. However, looking at the code in retrospect is quite a nightmare, and building upon the existing code was basically impossible. I have started another project where I am trying to recreate
the game with generalized software practices (for context, I built this project without even knowing what a class was...), and you can find that project over here: https://github.com/notbenwang/Project-Z
