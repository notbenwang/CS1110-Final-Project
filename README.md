# CS1110-Final-Project

The purpose of this project was to serve as a final project for the Intro CS course (CS 1110), and was completed in partnership with Thomas Nguyen. 
This project was created in Python and uses a Python library developed by Lucas Tychonievich (which you can see as the 'gamebox.py' file).

For more specific deals on the project, check the comments in the game.py file.

If for some reason you would ever want to run the game, you would need the game.py, gamebox.py, the images folder, and any other dependencies needed to get the python files to run in a directory (I believe it should just be pygame), and just need to run the game.py file.

If you're curious, I am trying to redevelop this game with more "sustainable" software practices, and you can find that page here: https://github.com/notbenwang/Project-Z
